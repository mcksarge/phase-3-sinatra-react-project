# ToDo App

This app is a simple "to do" tracker, where tasks can be created, assigned to people and categories.

##People

###Add new person
On the main page, you can view the people that are assigned to the household.  You can add a new person by typing a name into the field that says "Add new person..." and then by pressing "submit".  

###Delete person
You can delete a person from the household by clicking on the "X" next to their name on the list.  This will remove them from the list and tasks can no longer be assigned to them.

##Tasks

###Add new task
You can add a new task by clicking on the field that says "Enter a task..." under the "Add a New Task:" title in the blue box. Once you type in the name of the task, select a category for the task and assign it to someone in the household, then press "submit" to add it to the list of tasks below.

###Finishing tasks
You can finish a task and remove it from the list by clicking on "Done" button in the tan box at the bottom of each task in the list.  This will remove the task from the list.

###Re-assingning tasks
You can re-assign a task to someone else by finding the button with the persons name on it and clicking on it.  This will change the "Assigned To:" field to the new persons name and assign it to them in the database.

##Sorting tasks
You can sort the tasks either by name or by date created by pressing on either "Sort by name" or "Sort by date created" buttons just below the "Add a New Task" box.
